# fortnite-dmn
A universal way of communicating to kdm without any possible detection vectors hence the name Fortnite-DMN.
I created this project about a couple weeks ago while working on a external cheat and discovered this method. 
No i do not include the full init setup, however you need a brain. Its not hard to get NTDLL. 

# how-to-use
I put reading & base address function in this so maybe if this gets some stars I will implement the writing function to the public even though its already there.
Attach to a process with hiarchy privs, such as Fortnite/EOS/BE.

# future-changes
A unique way of implementing the shellcode to the function possibly a more stable one. 
Improve pd8 caching and possibly switch to pml4 entries.
Give public documenation to the Fortnite-Dmn-Signed and allow for others to add public commits.
